Pluralsight Skills Workspace Guided Text-based Adventure Game in Rust

## Repo Introduction

Instead of using the web lab I'm working on this locally with Vim.

## Project Introduction

In this lab, you have been given a text-based adventure game application in Rust. However, the major components have not been fully completed. As such, it will be your responsibility to finish each of their implementations within this lab.

The application can be run at any time by executing the `cargo run` command in the terminal or clicking the Run button in the terminal.

Note: You may notice that when completing tasks for earlier modules(ie. modules 1 and 2) the test output may still output warnings. This is normal as these warnings are just referencing the later modules you have not yet completed and will gradually disappear as you progress
